      <description>Please note that we recognize that &amp;ldquo;UNIX® is a registered trademark of The Open Group.&amp;rdquo; Any use within this class is for academic purposes only and when possible &amp;ldquo;NIX-like&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;GNU/Linux and the BSDs&amp;rdquo; will be used. Readers are encouraged to read the Unix History diagram by Éric Lévénez. While we&amp;rsquo;ll be covering many flavors of NIX-like Operating System but we will spend most of our time in OpenBSD and GNU/Linux/Debian otherwise known as &amp;ldquo;Debian.</description>

      <description>There are multiple branches on the UNIX tree but they all have fundamemtal similarities. A system built around the time of Windows 95 will have the same basic structure as a system built today. There are minor differences between the various distributions and flavors of UNIX but they have many of the same components and often the same ideology behind their design. Simply, you&amp;rsquo;ll always have a kernel, a shell, everything is a file, and most often a standardized set of commands accessible from the shell available in two major flavors the GNU Coreutils and Open Group POSIX.</description>
